//    Write a method to shuffle a deck of cards. It must be a perfect shuffle��in other
//    words, each of the 52! permutations of the deck has to be equally likely. Assume
//    that you are given a random number generator which is perfect.
//    
//    SOLUTION:
//    moving through the array and, for each element i, swapping array [i] with a random element
//    between 0 and i, inclusive.
